# Resume Portfolio Repository

This repository is a focused personal branding package for Alex Kwan, centered on two artifacts:

- `resume.md`: a career history and impact-oriented resume highlighting technical leadership, delivery outcomes, and full-stack experience.
- `leadershiponepager.md`: a leadership narrative that defines management philosophy, operating principles, and examples of team execution, growth, and decision-making.

## What this repo is really about

This repo is about positioning a senior engineering leader profile that combines:

- **People leadership** (coaching, performance clarity, team culture)
- **Execution rigor** (predictable delivery, risk management, cross-functional alignment)
- **Technical depth** (architecture, reliability, developer experience, operational ownership)

Together, the documents present a coherent story: a hands-on engineering manager who builds high-performing teams and ships meaningful, scalable products.

## Goal of this repo

The goal is to maintain a clear, reusable source of truth for leadership and resume materials that can be used for:

- job applications (especially senior/FAANG-level engineering management roles)
- interview preparation and storytelling
- consistent professional positioning across resume, networking, and recruiting channels

In short, this repo exists to communicate both **what was delivered** and **how leadership outcomes were achieved**.
