## Professional Summary

I started in cross-platform mobile and full-stack product development, then spent over a decade at Microsoft, growing from an individual contributor to a Senior Engineering Manager while staying hands-on with React, TypeScript, Node.js, and C# platforms. I build and lead teams that ship scalable customer-facing products, modernize engineering systems, and improve delivery through strong architecture, CI/CD, testing, and developer tooling. I believe great product experiences are created by teams with room to think creatively, reflect often, and take action; I care deeply about growing engineers into leaders and building shared ownership to solve customer problems and deliver meaningful outcomes.
