## Professional Summary

I started in cross-platform mobile and full-stack product development, then spent over a decade at Microsoft, growing from an individual contributor to a Senior Engineering Manager while staying hands-on with React/TypeScript web platforms. I led and scaled a 7-engineer team for the Azure Communication Services Web UI Library, drove architecture and delivery quality, launched and grew an open-source library to 6k+ weekly npm downloads, and worked with various partners to integrate note-taking and communication capabilities into existing experiences. I’m seeking an engineering role where I can combine people leadership and hands-on technical execution to build impactful, developer-first products, grow strong teams, and deliver amazing features with world-class excellence.
