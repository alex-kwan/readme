# Alex Kwan — Engineering Manager Leadership One‑Pager

## Leadership Philosophy
I believe high‑performing engineering teams are learning teams. When clarity, ownership, and continuous improvement are built into the team’s operating rhythm, engineers move fast without breaking trust. My role is to remove ambiguity, create an environment where people feel safe to take risks, and ensure the team ships meaningful value with technical excellence. I lead through principles and systems, not pressure — and I build teams that scale themselves.

---

## Leadership Signature
- I lead with clarity, curiosity, and calm under pressure  
- I turn ambiguity into alignment through structured thinking  
- I grow teams by raising the bar and giving them the space to reach it  

---

## How I Build and Lead Teams
- Establish psychological safety through predictable rituals, transparent communication, and consistent follow‑through  
- Set crisp expectations around ownership, quality, and decision‑making to reduce ambiguity and increase autonomy  
- Join the on‑call rotation to stay close to operational realities and understand the challenges the team faces firsthand  
- Keep teams close to users and metrics so decisions stay grounded in impact  
- Embed learning into the team’s DNA through daily micro‑rituals and structured sprint learning loops  
- Keep the team engaged and invested by celebrating growth, surfacing wins, and reinforcing shared ownership of outcomes  

**Example:**  
I received feedback that the architecture needed to be revisited, and morale dropped sharply — it’s tough to hear that months of work were heading in the wrong direction. I decided to open up the problem, hear out the issue space, and determine how we could be part of the solution. I brought the team together and reframed the situation around our true goal: building the most efficient, developer‑friendly product possible. I reminded them this wasn’t failure but an opportunity to deliver something better for our customers. There was a fair amount of coaching required across the team, with many difficult discussions, but they were all moving us in the right direction. I am ever grateful to have leadership that supported this learning opportunity for me and the team.

As I guided the pivot, I kept the team energized by celebrating each milestone and highlighting the improvements we were unlocking. The shift in mindset revitalized the team, and I ultimately led the release of a public preview of the SDK that delivered a meaningfully better experience for developers.

## How I Drive Execution
- Break down ambiguous problem spaces using scenario‑driven planning and risk modeling  
- Align PM, design, and engineering through shared definitions of success, tradeoffs, and measurable outcomes  
- Surface risks early and create fallback paths before they’re needed  
- Protect engineers from thrash by controlling scope, sequencing, and cross‑team dependencies  
- Maintain predictable delivery without sacrificing quality, velocity, or morale  
- Celebrate engineers who reduce friction, solve systemic issues, or elevate team velocity  

**Example:**  
I had a major architectural decision to make as part of a migration, and I saw it as an opportunity for a senior engineer to gain visibility and leadership experience. Instead of driving the decision myself, I asked him to lead the evaluation — framing the problem, gathering options, running design reviews, and presenting tradeoffs.

I made it clear that the engineering team would be the final decision‑makers, which created a strong sense of shared ownership. Engineers across the team contributed insights, challenged assumptions, and helped refine the proposal. Because everyone had a voice in the process, the team felt invested in the outcome rather than dictated to.

The senior engineer grew through leading a high‑impact decision, and I brought the team together around the chosen direction. That alignment made the migration smooth, collaborative, and ultimately successful.


**Example 2:**
There are times when new engineering initiatives emerge as challenges on the horizon. In this scenario, we had to balance our software release process while still giving ourselves time to develop features. This allowed us to ship bug fixes while still focusing on delivering features with excellence. I took it on myself to research and share a plan with our partners to address the issue. The challenge wasn’t really a software issue, but rather how we would coordinate with testing teams and other teams that also had bug fixes and features in the same release. Building quorum with the other engineering manager was key to creating alignment and gathering valuable feedback on what might be too frequent of a release cadence. We shared a broader plan that aligned both teams, and presenting it together made it easier to absorb as we iterated over time. The teams shared their own feedback and questions, which complemented the plan, and we were able to release effectively together over time.

## How I Partner with Product and Design
- Align early on the user problem, desired behavior change, and success metrics  
- Co-create scope by balancing user value, technical feasibility, and delivery risk  
- Use fast feedback loops (mock reviews, prototypes, and milestone demos) to reduce rework  
- Make tradeoffs explicit so speed decisions do not compromise user experience or system quality  
- Keep PM, design, and engineering accountable to shared outcomes, not siloed deliverables  

**Example:**  
Working on a client-side library, it was key to include the design and product teams in weekly discussions. This enabled the team to make faster decisions and deliver features in short order. In complex scenarios such as UI for video-calling accessibility, we needed to keep iterating on new designs. There were a number of challenges compounded by web design constraints beyond simply communicating a rich communications experience. How do we convey a similar set of information when users are on an iPhone Safari browser? What if someone requires even more accessibility controls? I made sure to communicate new engineering concerns in feature specifications, and I held weekly syncs with design and product to discuss how the feature would work. As the feature entered implementation, additional challenges emerged. I also reviewed the feature and had a number of coaching conversations across the team on the importance of maintaining good architecture to build consistency and readability. I am grateful for how quickly the team took in the feedback and refactored to align with the rest of the codebase. Having key stakeholders from different teams review weekly progress was key to our ability to ship the real-time text feature in the Azure Communication Services UI Library project by a critical due date.

## How I Grow People
- Coach through questions that build judgment, not dependency  
- Give feedback early, directly, and with a clear path forward  
- Identify stretch opportunities that build both capability and confidence  
- Support underperformance with clarity, structure, and empathy  
- Celebrate progress, not just outcomes, to reinforce growth mindsets  
- Spotlight engineers who step up to solve hard problems or improve team workflows  

**Example:**  
I stay closely connected to my team through weekly 1:1s where I create a space for engineers to talk openly about what excites them, what’s challenging, and where they want to grow. These conversations also give me the opportunity to share where I’m curious if we can move faster, or where I need to give more direct, constructive feedback.

I’m transparent about how I think about performance — I share my mental models, what “senior‑level ownership” looks like, and how I evaluate impact. As engineers internalize this, they begin to align their own decision‑making with those expectations. Over time, this clarity and coaching paid off: I later received unsolicited feedback from senior engineers that our junior engineers were operating at a senior level. That’s the outcome I aim for — a team that grows into leaders.

## How I Stay Technical
- Evaluate designs for clarity, failure modes, scalability, and long‑term maintainability  
- Stay close to the code through architecture reviews, pairing sessions, and debugging when needed  
- Guide technical decisions by framing tradeoffs and asking high‑leverage questions  
- Ensure observability, testing, and operational readiness are first‑class concerns  
- Maintain strong intuition for system behavior through modeling and scenario analysis  
- Participate in on‑call rotations to stay grounded in real operational challenges and improve system reliability  

**Example:**  
I stay deeply involved in technical design discussions, not to dictate solutions but to validate our thinking and ensure we’re solving the right problems in the simplest way possible. I review design docs, ask clarifying questions, and share feedback that helps the team pressure‑test assumptions and confirm we’re on the right track.

I believe mastery shows up in how simply we can explain complex systems, so I pay close attention to how engineers teach each other during reviews and walkthroughs. Their explanations help me understand where the design is elegant, where it’s overly complex, and where we can simplify. This keeps me grounded in the technical details while reinforcing a culture where clarity and shared understanding matter as much as correctness.

## How I Make Decisions
- Start with user impact and long‑term value  
- Clarify constjngv raints, risks, and success metrics  
- Evaluate tradeoffs collaboratively and transparently  
- Choose the simplest solution that scales  
- Document decisions so the team can move fast with confidence  

---

## How I Handle Conflict
- Surface misalignment early before it calcifies  
- Reframe discussions around shared goals and constraints  
- Separate people from problems to keep conversations constructive  
- Drive toward clarity, not consensus, so decisions move forward  

---

## What I Expect From My Team
- Ownership over outcomes, not tasks  
- Clear, proactive communication  
- Curiosity, learning, and willingness to challenge assumptions  
- Kindness, honesty, and accountability  

---

## Leadership Outcomes
- Teams that ship predictably and with pride  
- Engineers who grow faster than they expected  
- Clear decision‑making that reduces thrash  
- A culture where learning and ownership compound over time  

---

## Operating Principles
- Clarity removes 80% of conflict  
- Ownership beats oversight  
- Default to transparency  
- Slow is smooth, smooth is fast  
- Feedback is a gift, not a verdict  
- Users define value, not roadmaps  
- Systems scale better than heroics  
- Learning is a daily habit, not a quarterly event  
- Leaders stay close to the work, not above it  

**Example (learning principle):**  
I introduced a lightweight learning ritual: in standups, one person shares something they learned — even if it’s small. At sprint’s end, I run a structured retro: what went well, what could be improved, and what we want to try next. Within two sprints, the team was proposing their own experiments, improving CI reliability, and tightening our definition of done.
